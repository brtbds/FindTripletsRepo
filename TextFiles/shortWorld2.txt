Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about one million dollars for each hour we work.  One
hundred hours is a conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar, then we produce a
million dollars per hour; next year we will have to do four text
files per month, thus upping our productivity to two million/hr.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers.

****START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START****

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT

By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext,
you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept this
"Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive a
refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by sending
a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person you got
it from.  If you received this etext on a physical medium (such
as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS

This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association (the
"Project").  Among other things, this means that no one owns a
United States copyright on or for this work, so the Project (and
you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special
rules, set forth below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute
this etext under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable efforts
to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain works.
Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any medium they
may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other things, Defects
may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data,
transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual property
infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other etext medium,
a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be
read by your equipment.

DISCLAIMER

But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this etext
from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all liability to
you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees, and
[2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR UNDER STRICT LIABILI-
TY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL
DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any) you
paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that time to
the person you received it from.  If you received it on a
physical medium, you must return it with your note, and such
person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement copy.
If you received it electronically, such person may choose to
alternatively give you a second opportunity to receive it elec-
tronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY

You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise from any

     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at no

:Afghanistan Economy

Overview:
    Fundamentally, Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked country, highly
    dependent on farming (wheat especially) and livestock raising (sheep and
    goats). Economic considerations, however, have played second fiddle to
    political and military upheavals during more than 13 years of war, including
    the nearly 10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended 15 February
    1989). Over the past decade, one-third of the population fled the country,
    with Pakistan sheltering more than 3 million refugees and Iran about 1.3
    million. Another 1 million probably moved into and around urban areas within
    Afghanistan. Although reliable data are unavailable, gross domestic product
    is lower than 12 years ago because of the loss of labor and capital and the
    disruption of trade and transport.

    (1989 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):

  commodities:
    food and petroleum products
  partners:
    mostly former USSR
External debt:
    $2.3 billion (March 1991 est.)
Industrial production:
    growth rate 2.3% (FY91 est.); accounts for about 25% of GDP

    480,000 kW capacity; 1,450 million kWh produced, 90 kWh per capita (1991)
Industries:
    small-scale production of textiles, soap, furniture, shoes, fertilizer, and
    cement; handwoven carpets; natural gas, oil, coal, copper
Agriculture:
    largely subsistence farming and nomadic animal husbandry; cash products -
    wheat, fruits, nuts, karakul pelts, wool, mutton
Illicit drugs:
    an illicit producer of opium poppy and cannabis for the international drug
    trade; world's second-largest opium producer (after Burma) and a major
    source of hashish

    US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY70-89), $380 million; Western (non-US)
    countries, ODA and OOF bilateral commitments (1970-89), $510 million; OPEC

:Albania Economy

Overview:
    The Albanian economy, already providing the lowest standard of living in
    Europe, contracted sharply in 1991, with most industries producing at only a
    fraction of past levels and an unemployment rate estimated at 40%. For over
    40 years, the Stalinist-type economy has operated on the principle of
    central planning and state ownership of the means of production. Albania
    began fitful economic reforms during 1991, including the liberalization of
    prices and trade, the privatization of shops and transport, and land reform.
    These reform measures were crippled, however, by the widespread civil
    disorder that accompanied the collapse of the Communist state. Following
    their overwhelming victory in the 22 March 1991 elections, the new
    Democratic government announced a program of shock therapy to stabilize the
    economy and establish a market economy. In an effort to expand international
    ties, Tirane has reestablished diplomatic relations with the former Soviet
    Union and the US and has joined the IMF and World Bank. The Albanians have
    also passed legislation allowing foreign investment. Albania possesses
    considerable mineral resources and, until 1990, was largely self-sufficient
    in food; however, the breakup of cooperative farms in 1991 and general
    economic decline forced Albania to rely on foreign aid to maintain adequate
    supplies. Available statistics on Albanian economic activity are rudimentary
    and subject to an especially wide margin of error.

:Algeria Economy

Overview:
    The oil and natural gas sector forms the backbone of the economy. Algeria
    depends on hydrocarbons for nearly all of its export receipts, about 30% of
    government revenues, and nearly 25% of GDP. In 1973-74 the sharp increase in
    oil prices led to a booming economy and helped to finance an ambitious
    program of industrialization. Plunging oil and gas prices, combined with the
    mismanagement of Algeria's highly centralized economy, has brought the
    nation to its most serious social and economic crisis since independence in
    1988. The government has promised far-reaching reforms, including
    privatization of some public- sector companies, encouraging private-sector
    activity, boosting gas and nonhydrocarbon exports, and proposing a major
    overhaul of the banking and financial systems, but to date it has made only
    limited progress.

    plants are the backbone of the private-sector economy, with canned tuna the
    primary export. The tuna canneries and the government are by far the two
    largest employers. Other economic activities include a slowly developing
    tourist industry.

:Andorra Economy

Overview:
    The mainstay of Andorra's economy is tourism. An estimated 13 million
    tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its
    summer and winter resorts. Agricultural production is limited by a scarcity
    of arable land, and most food has to be imported. The principal livestock
    activity is sheep raising. Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes,
    cigars, and furniture. The rapid pace of European economic integration is a
    potential threat to Andorra's advantages from its duty-free status.

:Angola Economy

Overview:
    Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 80-90% of the
    population, but accounts for less than 15% of GDP. Oil production is vital
    to the economy, contributing about 60% to GDP. In recent years, a bitter
    internal war has severely affected the nonoil economy, and food has to be
    imported. For the long run, Angola has the advantage of rich natural
    resources in addition to oil, notably gold, diamonds, and arable land. To
    realize its economic potential Angola not only must secure domestic peace
    but also must reform government policies that have led to distortions and
    imbalances throughout the economy.

Total area:
    14,000,000 km2 (est.)
Land area:
    about 14,000,000 km2
Comparative area:

    (after Australia)
Land boundaries:
    none, but see entry on Disputes
Coastline:
    17,968 km
Maritime claims:
    none, but see entry on Disputes
Disputes:
    Antarctic Treaty defers claims (see Antarctic Treaty Summary below);
    sections (some overlapping) claimed by Argentina, Australia, Chile, France
    (Adelie Land), New Zealand (Ross Dependency), Norway (Queen Maud Land), and
    UK; the US and Russia do not recognize the territorial claims of other
    nations and have made no claims themselves (but reserve the right to do so);
    no formal claims have been made in the sector between 90. west and 150.
    west, where, because of floating ice, Antarctica is unapproachable from the
    sea
Climate:
    severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and distance from the
    ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West Antarctica because of its higher
    elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has the most moderate climate; higher
    temperatures occur in January along the coast and average slightly below
    freezing
Terrain:
    about 98% thick continental ice sheet and 2% barren rock, with average
    elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters; mountain ranges up to 4,897
    meters high; ice-free coastal areas include parts of southern Victoria Land,
    Wilkes Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area, and Ross Island on McMurdo Sound;
    glaciers form ice shelves along about half of the coastline, and floating
    ice shelves constitute 11% of the area of the continent
Natural resources:
    none presently exploited; iron, chromium, copper, gold, nickel, platinum,
    and other minerals, and coal and hydrocarbons have been found in small,
    uncommercial quantities
Land use:
    no arable land and no plant growth; ice 98%, barren rock 2%
Environment:
    mostly uninhabitable; katabatic (gravity-driven) winds blow coastward from
    the high interior; frequent blizzards form near the foot of the plateau; a
    circumpolar ocean current flows clockwise along the coast as do cyclonic
    storms that form over the ocean; during summer more solar radiation reaches
    the surface at the South Pole than is received at the Equator in an
    equivalent period; in October 1991 it was reported that the ozone shield,
    which protects the Earth's surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation, had
    dwindled to its lowest level ever over Antarctica; active volcanism on
    Deception Island and isolated areas of West Antarctica; other seismic
    activity rare and weak

:Antigua and Barbuda Economy

Overview:
    The economy is primarily service oriented, with tourism the most important
    determinant of economic performance. During the period 1987-90, real GDP
    expanded at an annual average rate of about 6%. Tourism makes a direct
    contribution to GDP of about 13% and also affects growth in other sectors -
    particularly in construction, communications, and public utilities. Although
    Antigua and Barbuda is one of the few areas in the Caribbean experiencing a
    labor shortage in some sectors of the economy, it was hurt in 1991 by a
    downturn in tourism caused by the Persian Gulf war and the US recession.

:Argentina Economy

Overview:
    Argentina is rich in natural resources and has a highly literate population,
    an export-oriented agricultural sector, and a diversified industrial base.
    Nevertheless, following decades of mismanagement and statist policies, the
    economy has encountered major problems in recent years, leading to
    escalating inflation and a recession during 1988-90. Since 1978, Argentina's
    external debt has nearly doubled to $58 billion, creating severe debt
    servicing difficulties and hurting the country's creditworthiness with
    international lenders. Elected in 1989, President Menem has implemented a
    comprehensive economic restructuring program that shows signs of reversing
    Argentina's economic decline and putting it on a path of stable, sustainable
    growth.

:Armenia Economy

Overview:
    Armenia under the old centrally planned Soviet system had built up textile,
    machine-building, and other industries and had become a key supplier to
    sister republics. In turn, Armenia had depended on supplies of raw materials
    and energy from the other republics. Most of these supplies enter the
    republic by rail through Azerbaijan (85%) and Georgia (15%). The economy has
    been severely hurt by ethnic strife with Azerbaijan over control of the
    Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, a mostly Armenian-populated enclave
    within the national boundaries of Azerbaijan. In addition to outright
    warfare, the strife has included interdiction of Armenian imports on the
    Azerbaijani railroads and expensive airlifts of supplies to beleagured
    Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. An earthquake in December 1988 destroyed
    about one-tenth of industrial capacity and housing, the repair of which has
    not been possible because the supply of funds and real resources has been
    disrupted by the reorganization and subsequent dismantling of the central
    USSR administrative apparatus. Among facilities made unserviceable by the
    earthquake are the Yerevan nuclear power plant, which had supplied 40% of
    Armenia's needs for electric power and a plant that produced one-quarter of
    the output of elevators in the former USSR. Armenia has some deposits of
    nonferrous metal ores (bauxite, copper, zinc, and molybdenum) that are
    largely unexploited. For the mid-term, Armenia's economic prospects seem
    particularly bleak because of ethnic strife and the unusually high
    dependence on outside areas, themselves in a chaotic state of
    transformation.

:Australia Economy

Overview:
    Australia has a prosperous Western-style capitalist economy, with a per
    capita GDP comparable to levels in industrialized West European countries.
    Rich in natural resources, Australia is a major exporter of agricultural
    products, minerals, metals, and fossil fuels. Of the top 25 exports, 21 are
    primary products, so that, as happened during 1983-84, a downturn in world
    commodity prices can have a big impact on the economy. The government is
    pushing for increased exports of manufactured goods, but competition in
    international markets continues to be severe.

:Austria Economy

Overview:
    Austria boasts a prosperous and stable capitalist economy with a sizable
    proportion of nationalized industry and extensive welfare benefits. Thanks
    to an excellent raw material endowment, a technically skilled labor force,
    and strong links to German industrial firms, Austria occupies specialized
    niches in European industry and services (tourism, banking) and produces
    almost enough food to feed itself with only 8% of the labor force in
    agriculture. Improved export prospects resulting from German unification and
    the opening of Eastern Europe, boosted the economy during 1990 and to a
    lesser extent in 1991. GDP growth slowed from 4.9% in 1990 to 3% in 1991 -
    mainly due to the weaker world economy - and is expected to drop to around
    2% in 1992. Inflation is forecasted at about 4%, while unemployment probably
    will increase moderately through 1992 before declining in 1993. Living
    standards are comparable with the large industrial countries of Western
    Europe. Problems for the l990s include an aging population, the high level
    of subsidies, and the struggle to keep welfare benefits within budget
    capabilities. Austria, which has applied for EC membership, was involved in
    EC and European Free Trade Association negotiations for a European Economic
    Area and will have to adapt its economy to achieve freer interchange of
    goods, services, capital, and labor within the EC.

:Azerbaijan Economy

Overview:
    Azerbaijan is less developed industrially than either Armenia or Georgia,
    the other Transcaucasian states. It resembles the Central Asian states in
    its majority Muslim population, high structural unemployment, and low
    standard of living. The economy's most prominent products are cotton, oil,
    and gas. Production from the Caspian oil and gas field has been in decline
    for several years. With foreign assistance, the oil industry might generate
    the funds needed to spur industrial development. However, civil unrest,
    marked by armed conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region between Muslim
    Azeris and Christian Armenians, makes foreign investors wary. Azerbaijan
    accounts for 1.5% to 2% of the capital stock and output of the former Soviet
    Union. Although immediate economic prospects are not favorable because of
    civil strife, lack of economic reform, political disputes about new economic
    arrangements, and the skittishness of foreign investors, Azerbaijan's
    economic performance was the best of all former Soviet republics in 1991
    largely because of its reliance on domestic resources for industrial output.

:The Bahamas Economy

    the annual increase in the number of tourists slowed. Nonetheless, the per
    capita GDP of $9,900 is one of the highest in the region.

:Bahrain Economy

Overview:
    Petroleum production and processing account for about 80% of export
    receipts, 60% of government revenues, and 31% of GDP. Economic conditions
    have fluctuated with the changing fortunes of oil since 1985, for example,
    the Gulf crisis of 1990-91. The liberation of Kuwait in early 1991 has
    improved short- to medium-term prospects and has raised investors'
    confidence. Bahrain with its highly developed communication and transport
    facilities is home to numerous multinational firms with business in the
    Gulf. A large share of exports is petroleum products made from imported
    crude.

:Bangladesh Economy

Overview:
    Bangladesh is one of the poorest nations in the world. The economy is based
    on the output of a narrow range of agricultural products, such as jute,
    which is the main cash crop and major source of export earnings, and rice.
    Bangladesh is hampered by a relative lack of natural resources, population
    growth of more than 2% a year, large-scale unemployment, and a limited
    infrastructure; furthermore, it is highly vulnerable to natural disasters.
    Despite these constraints, real GDP growth averaged about 3.5% annually
    during 1985-89. A strong agricultural performance in FY90 pushed the growth
    rate up to 6.2%, and FY91 saw further, though smaller, increases in output.
    Alleviation of poverty remains the cornerstone of the government's
    development strategy.

:Macedonia Economy

Overview:
    Macedonia, although the poorest among the six republics of a disintegrated
    Yugoslav federation, can meet basic food and energy needs through its own
    agricultural and coal resources. As a breakaway republic, however, it will
    move down toward a bare subsistence level of life unless economic ties are
    reforged or enlarged with its neighbors Serbia, Albania, Greece, and
    Bulgaria. The economy depends on outside sources for all of its oil and gas
    and its modern machinery and parts. Continued political turmoil, both
    internally and in the region as a whole, prevents any swift readjustments of
    trade patterns and economic rules of the game. Inflation in early 1992 was
    out of control, the result of fracturing trade links, the decline in
    economic activity, and general uncertainties about the future status of the
    country; prices rose 38% in March 1992 alone. Macedonia's geographical
    isolation, technological backwardness, and political instability place it
    far down the list of countries of interest to Western investors. Recognition
    of Macedonia by the EC and an internal commitment to economic reform would
    help to encourage foreign investment over the long run.

    tobacco
Agriculture:
    provides 12% of Macedonia's GDP and meets the basic need for food; principal
    crops are rice, tobacco, wheat, corn, and millet; also grown are cotton,
    sesame, mulberry leaves, citrus fruit, and vegetables; Macedonia is one of
    the seven legal cultivators of the opium poppy for the world pharmaceutical

:Madagascar Economy

Overview:
    Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world. Agriculture,
    including fishing and forestry, is the mainstay of the economy, accounting
    for over 40% of GDP, employing about 80% of the labor force, and
    contributing to more than 70% of total export earnings. Industry is largely
    confined to the processing of agricultural products and textile
    manufacturing; in 1990 it accounted for only 16% of GDP and employed almost
    5% of the labor force. In 1986 the government introduced a five-year
    development plan that stressed self-sufficiency in food (mainly rice) by
    1990, increased production for exports, and reduced energy imports. After
    mid-1991, however, output dropped sharply because of protracted
    antigovernment strikes and demonstrations for political reform.

:Malawi Economy

Overview:

    revenues. After two years of weak performance, economic growth improved
    significantly in 1988-91 as a result of good weather and a broadly based

:Malaysia Economy

Overview:
    During the period 1988-91 booming exports helped Malaysia continue to
    recover from the severe 1985-86 recession. Real output grew by 8.8% in 1989,
    10% in 1990, and 8.6% in 1991, helped by vigorous growth in manufacturing
    output, further increases in foreign direct investment - particularly from
    Japanese and Taiwanese firms facing higher costs at home - and increased oil
    production. Malaysia has become the world's third-largest producer of
    semiconductor devices (after the US and Japan) and the world's largest
    exporter of semiconductor devices. Inflation has remained low; unemployment
    has stood at 6% of the labor force; and the government has followed prudent
    fiscal/monetary policies. The country is not self-sufficient in food, and
    some of the rural population subsist at the poverty level. Malaysia's high
    export dependence leaves it vulnerable to a recession in the OECD countries
    or a fall in world commodity prices.

:Maldives Economy

Overview:
    The economy is based on fishing, tourism, and shipping. Agriculture is
    limited to the production of a few subsistence crops that provide only 10%
    of food requirements. Fishing is the largest industry, employing 25% of the
    work force and accounting for over 60% of exports; it is also an important
    source of government revenue. During the 1980s tourism has become one of the
    most important and highest growth sectors of the economy. In 1988 industry

:Malta Economy

Overview:
    Significant resources are limestone, a favorable geographic location, and a
    productive labor force. Malta produces only about 20% of its food needs, has
    limited freshwater supplies, and has no domestic energy sources.
    Consequently, the economy is highly dependent on foreign trade and services.
    Manufacturing and tourism are the largest contributors to the economy.
    Manufacturing accounts for about 27% of GDP, with the electronics and
    textile industries major contributors. In 1990 inflation was held to a low
    3.0%. Per capita GDP at $7,000 places Malta in the middle-income range of
    the world's nations.

:Man, Isle of Economy

Overview:
    Offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism are key sectors of the economy.
    The government's policy of offering incentives to high-technology companies
    and financial institutions to locate on the island has paid off in expanding
    employment opportunities in high-income industries. As a result, agriculture
    and fishing, once the mainstays of the economy, have declined in their
    shares of GNP. Banking now contributes over 20% to GNP and manufacturing
    about 15%. Trade is mostly with the UK.

:Marshall Islands Economy

Overview:
    Agriculture and tourism are the mainstays of the economy. Agricultural
    production is concentrated on small farms, and the most important commercial
    crops are coconuts, tomatoes, melons, and breadfruit. A few cattle ranches

    handicrafts, fish processing, and copra. The tourist industry is the primary
    source of foreign exchange and employs about 10% of the labor force. The
    islands have few natural resources, and imports far exceed exports. In 1987
    the US Government provided grants of $40 million out of the Marshallese
    budget of $55 million.

:Martinique Economy

Overview:
    The economy is based on sugarcane, bananas, tourism, and light industry.
    Agriculture accounts for about 12% of GDP and the small industrial sector
    for 10%. Sugar production has declined, with most of the sugarcane now used
    for the production of rum. Banana exports are increasing, going mostly to
    France. The bulk of meat, vegetable, and grain requirements must be
    imported, contributing to a chronic trade deficit that requires large annual
    transfers of aid from France. Tourism has become more important than
    agricultural exports as a source of foreign exchange. The majority of the
    work force is employed in the service sector and in administration. In 1986
    per capita GDP was relatively high at $6,000. During 1986 the unemployment
    rate was 30% and was particularly severe among younger workers.

:Mauritania Economy

Overview:
    A majority of the population still depends on agriculture and livestock for
    a livelihood, even though most of the nomads and many subsistence farmers
    were forced into the cities by recurrent droughts in the 1970s and 1980s.
    Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore, which account for almost 50%
    of total exports. The decline in world demand for this ore, however, has led
    to cutbacks in production. The nation's coastal waters are among the richest
    fishing areas in the world, but overexploitation by foreigners threatens
    this key source of revenue. The country's first deepwater port opened near
    Nouakchott in 1986. In recent years, the droughts, the endemic conflict with
    Senegal, rising energy costs, and economic mismanagement have resulted in a
    substantial buildup of foreign debt. The government has begun the second
    stage of an economic reform program in consultation with the World Bank, the
    IMF, and major donor countries. But the reform process suffered a major
    setback following the Gulf war of early 1991. Because of Mauritania's
    support of Saddam Husayn, bilateral aid from its two top donors, Saudi
    Arabia and Kuwait, was suspended, and multilateral aid was reduced.

:Mexico Economy

Overview:
    Mexico's economy is a mixture of state-owned industrial plants (notably
    oil), private manufacturing and services, and both large-scale and
    traditional agriculture. In the 1980s, Mexico experienced severe economic
    difficulties: the nation accumulated large external debts as world petroleum
    prices fell; rapid population growth outstripped the domestic food supply;
    and inflation, unemployment, and pressures to emigrate became more acute.
    Growth in national output, however, is recovering, rising from 1.4% in 1988
    to 4% in 1990 and again in 1991. The US is Mexico's major trading partner,
    accounting for two-thirds of its exports and imports. After petroleum,
    border assembly plants and tourism are the largest earners of foreign
    exchange. The government, in consultation with international economic
    agencies, is implementing programs to stabilize the economy and foster
    growth. In 1991 the government began negotiations with the US and Canada on
    a free trade agreement.

:Micronesia, Federated States of Economy

Overview:
    Economic activity consists primarily of subsistence farming and fishing. The
    islands have few mineral deposits worth exploiting, except for high-grade

    Financial assistance from the US is the primary source of revenue, with the
    US pledged to spend $1 billion in the islands in the l990s. Geographical
    isolation and a poorly developed infrastructure are major impediments to
    long-term growth.

:Moldova Economy

Overview:
    Moldova, the next-to-smallest of the former Soviet republics in area, is the
    most densely inhabited. Moldova has a little more than 1% of the population,
    labor force, capital stock, and output of the former Soviet Union. Living
    standards have been below average for the European USSR. The country enjoys
    a favorable climate, and economic development has been primarily based on
    agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine, and tobacco. Industry
    accounts for 20% of the labor force, whereas agriculture employs more than
    one-third. Moldova has no major mineral resources and has depended on the
    former Soviet republics for coal, oil, gas, steel, most electronic
    equipment, machine tools, and major consumer durables such as automobiles.
    Its industrial and agricultural products, in turn, have been exported to the
    other former Soviet republics. Moldova has freed prices on most goods and
    has legalized private ownership of property, including agricultural land.
    Moldova's economic prospects are dimmed by the difficulties of moving toward
    a market economy and the political problems of redefining ties to the other
    former Soviet republics and Romania.

:Monaco Economy

Overview:
    Monaco, situated on the French Mediterranean coast, is a popular resort,
    attracting tourists to its casino and pleasant climate. The Principality has
    successfully sought to diversify into services and small, high-value-added,
    nonpolluting industries. The state has no income tax and low business taxes
    and thrives as a tax haven both for individuals who have established
    residence and for foreign companies that have set up businesses and offices.
    About 50% of Monaco's annual revenue comes from value-added taxes on hotels,
    banks, and the industrial sector; about 25% of revenue comes from tourism.
    Living standards are high, that is, roughly comparable to those in
    prosperous French metropolitan suburbs.

:Mongolia Economy

Overview:
    Mongolia's severe climate, scattered population, and wide expanses of
    unproductive land have constrained economic development. Economic activity
    traditionally has been based on agriculture and the breeding of livestock -
    Mongolia has the highest number of livestock per person in the world. In
    recent years extensive mineral resources have been developed with Soviet
    support. The mining and processing of coal, copper, molybdenum, tin,
    tungsten, and gold account for a large part of industrial production. Timber
    and fishing are also important sectors. In 1991-92 Mongolian leadership is
    struggling with severe economic dislocations, mainly attributable to the
    economic crumbling of the USSR, by far Mongolia's leading trade and
    development partner. Moscow almost certainly cut aid in 1991, and the
    dissolution of the USSR at yearend 1991 makes prospects for aid quite bleak
    for 1992. Industry in 1991-92 has been hit hard by energy shortages, mainly
    due to disruptions in coal production and shortfalls in petroleum imports.
    The government is moving away from the Soviet-style centrally planned
    economy through privatization and price reform.

:Morocco Economy

Overview:
    The economy had recovered moderately in 1990 because of: the resolution of a
    trade dispute with India over phosphoric acid sales, a rebound in textile
    sales to the EC, lower prices for food imports, a sharp increase in worker
    remittances, increased Arab donor aid, and generous debt rescheduling
    agreements. Economic performance in 1991 was mixed. A record harvest helped
    real GDP advance by 4.2%, although nonagricultural output grew by less than
    1%. Inflation accelerated slightly as easier financial policies triggered
    rapid credit and monetary growth. Despite recovery of domestic demand,
    import volume growth slowed while export volume was adversely affected by
    phosphate marketing difficulties. In January 1992, Morocco reached a new
    12-month standby arrangement for $129 million with the IMF. In February
    1992, the Paris Club rescheduled $1.4 billion of Morocco's commercial debt.
    This is thought to be Morocco's last rescheduling. By 1993 the Moroccan
    authorities hope to be in a position to meet all debt service obligations
    without additional rescheduling. Servicing this large debt, high
    unemployment, and Morocco's vulnerability to external economic forces remain
    severe long-term problems.

:Mozambique Economy

Overview:
    One of Africa's poorest countries, Mozambique has failed to exploit the
    economic potential of its sizable agricultural, hydropower, and
    transportation resources. Indeed, national output, consumption, and
    investment declined throughout the first half of the 1980s because of
    internal disorders, lack of government administrative control, and a growing
    foreign debt. A sharp increase in foreign aid, attracted by an economic
    reform policy, has resulted in successive years of economic growth since
    1985. Agricultural output, nevertheless, is at about only 75% of its 1981
    level, and grain has to be imported. Industry operates at only 20-40% of
    capacity. The economy depends heavily on foreign assistance to keep afloat.
    The continuation of civil strife through 1991 has dimmed chances of foreign
    investment, and growth was a mere 1%. Living standards, already abysmally
    low, dropped by 3-4% in both 1990 and 1991.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $1.7 billion, per capita $120; real growth rate

:Namibia Economy

Overview:
    The economy is heavily dependent on the mining industry to extract and
    process minerals for export. Mining accounts for almost 25% of GDP. Namibia
    is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel minerals in Africa and the world's
    fifth-largest producer of uranium. Alluvial diamond deposits are among the
    richest in the world, making Namibia a primary source for gem-quality
    diamonds. Namibia also produces large quantities of lead, zinc, tin, silver,
    and tungsten, and it has substantial resources of coal. More than half the
    population depends on agriculture (largely subsistence agriculture) for its
    livelihood.

:Nauru Economy

Overview:
    Revenues come from the export of phosphates, the reserves of which are
    expected to be exhausted by the year 2000. Phosphates have given Nauruans
    one of the highest per capita incomes in the Third World - $10,000 annually.
    Few other resources exist, so most necessities must be imported, including
    fresh water from Australia. The rehabilitation of mined land and the
    replacement of income from phosphates are serious long-term problems.
    Substantial amounts of phosphate income are invested in trust funds to help
    cushion the transition.

:Nepal Economy

Overview:
    Nepal is among the poorest and least developed countries in the world.
    Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing a livelihood for over
    90% of the population and accounting for 60% of GDP. Industrial activity is
    limited, mainly involving the processing of agricultural produce (jute,
    sugarcane, tobacco, and grain). Production of textiles and carpets has
    expanded recently and accounted for 87% of foreign exchange earnings in
    FY89. Apart from agricultural land and forests, the only other exploitable
    natural resources are mica, hydropower, and tourism. Agricultural production
    in the late 1980s grew by about 5%, as compared with annual population
    growth of 2.6%. Forty percent or more of the population is undernourished
    partly because of poor distribution. Since May 1991, the government has been
    encouraging privatization and foreign investment. It has introduced policies
    to eliminate many business licenses and registration requirements in order
    to simplify domestic and foreign investment procedures. Economic prospects
    for the 1990s remain poor because the economy starts from such a low base.

:Netherlands Economy

Overview:
    This highly developed and affluent economy is based on private enterprise.
    The government makes its presence felt, however, through many regulations,
    permit requirements, and welfare programs affecting most aspects of economic
    activity. The trade and financial services sector contributes over 50% of
    GDP. Industrial activity provides about 25% of GDP and is led by the
    food-processing, oil-refining, and metalworking industries. The highly
    mechanized agricultural sector employs only 5% of the labor force, but
    provides large surpluses for export and the domestic food-processing
    industry. An unemployment rate of 6.2% and a sizable budget deficit are
    currently the most serious economic problems.

:New Zealand Economy

Overview:
    Since 1984 the government has been reorienting an agrarian economy dependent
    on a guaranteed British market to an open free market economy that can
    compete on the global scene. The government has hoped that dynamic growth
    would boost real incomes, reduce inflationary pressures, and permit the
    expansion of welfare benefits. The results have been mixed: inflation is
    down from double-digit levels, but growth has been sluggish and
    unemployment, always a highly sensitive issue, has exceeded 10% since May
    1991. In 1988, GDP fell by 1%, in 1989 grew by a moderate 2.4%, and was flat
    in 1990-91.

:Nicaragua Economy

Overview:
    Government control of the economy historically has been extensive, although
    the CHAMORRO government has pledged to greatly reduce intervention. Four
    private banks have been licensed, and the government has liberalized foreign
    trade and abolished price controls on most goods. Over 50% of the
    agricultural and industrial firms remain state owned. Sandinista economic
    policies and the war had produced a severe economic crisis. The foundation
    of the economy continues to be the export of agricultural commodities,
    largely coffee and cotton. Farm production fell by roughly 7% in 1989 and 4%
    in 1990, and remained about even in 1991. The agricultural sector employs
    44% of the work force and accounts for 15% of GDP and 80% of export
    earnings. Industry, which employs 13% of the work force and contributes
    about 25% to GDP, showed a drop of 7% in 1989, fell slightly in 1990, and
    remained flat in 1991; output still is below pre-1979 levels. External debt
    is one of the highest in the world on a per capita basis. In 1991 the
    inflation rate was 766%, down sharply from the 13,490% of 1990.

:Niger Economy

Overview:
    About 90% of the population is engaged in farming and stock raising,
    activities that generate almost half the national income. The economy also
    depends heavily on exploitation of large uranium deposits. Uranium
    production grew rapidly in the mid-1970s, but tapered off in the early 1980s
    when world prices declined. France is a major customer, while Germany,
    Japan, and Spain also make regular purchases. The depressed demand for
    uranium has contributed to an overall sluggishness in the economy, a severe
    trade imbalance, and a mounting external debt.

:Nigeria Economy

Overview:
    Although Nigeria is Africa's leading oil-producing country, it remains poor
    with a $250 per capita GDP. In 1991 massive government spending, much of it
    to help ensure a smooth transition to civilian rule, ballooned the budget
    deficit and caused inflation and interest rates to rise. The lack of fiscal
    discipline forced the IMF to declare Nigeria not in compliance with an
    18-month standby facility started in January 1991. Lagos has set ambitious
    targets for expanding oil production capacity and is offering foreign
    companies more attractive investment incentives. Government efforts to
    reduce Nigeria's dependence on oil exports and to sustain noninflationary
    growth, however, have fallen short because of inadequate new investment
    funds and endemic corruption. Living standards continue to deteriorate from
    the higher level of the early 1980s oil boom.

    The economy is heavily dependent on aid from New Zealand. Government
    expenditures regularly exceed revenues, with the shortfall made up by grants
    from New Zealand - the grants are used to pay wages to public employees. The
    agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence gardening, although some
    cash crops are grown for export. Industry consists primarily of small
    factories to process passion fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The
    sale of postage stamps to foreign collectors is an important source of
    revenue. The island in recent years has suffered a serious loss of
    population because of migration of Niueans to New Zealand.

:Norway Economy

Overview:
    Norway has a mixed economy involving a combination of free market activity
    and government intervention. The government controls key areas, such as the
    vital petroleum sector, through large-scale state enterprises and
    extensively subsidizes agricultural, fishing, and other sectors. Norway also
    maintains an extensive welfare system that helps propel public-sector
    expenditures to slightly more than 50% of the GDP and results in one of the
    highest average tax burdens in the world (54%). A small country with a high
    dependence on international trade, Norway is basically an exporter of raw
    materials and semiprocessed goods, with an abundance of small- and
    medium-sized firms, and is ranked among the major shipping nations. The
    country is richly endowed with natural resources - petroleum, hydropower,
    fish, forests, and minerals - and is highly dependent on its oil sector to
    keep its economy afloat. Although one of the government's main priorities is
    to reduce this dependency, this situation is not likely to improve for years
    to come. The government also hopes to reduce unemployment and strengthen and
    diversify the economy through tax reform and an expansionary 1992 budget.
    Forecasters predict that economic growth will rise slightly in 1992 because
    of public-sector expansion and moderate improvements in private investment
    and demand. Inflation will remain about 3%, while unemployment continues at
    record levels of over 5% because of the weakness of the economy outside the
    oil sector. Oslo, a member of the European Free Trade Area, is continuing to
    deregulate and harmonize with EC regulations to prepare for the European
    Economic Area (EEA) - which creates a EC/EFTA market with free movement of
    capital, goods, services, and labor - which takes effect in 1993.

:Pacific Ocean Geography

Total area:
    165,384,000 km2
Land area:
    165,384,000 km2; includes Arafura Sea, Banda Sea, Bellingshausen Sea, Bering
    Sea, Bering Strait, Coral Sea, East China Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Makassar
    Strait, Philippine Sea, Ross Sea, Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, South China
    Sea, Tasman Sea, and other tributary water bodies
Comparative area:
    slightly less than 18 times the size of the US; the largest ocean (followed
    by the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean); covers about
    one-third of the global surface; larger than the total land area of the
    world
Coastline:
    135,663 km
Disputes:
    some maritime disputes (see littoral states)
Climate:
    the western Pacific is monsoonal - a rainy season occurs during the summer
    months, when moisture-laden winds blow from the ocean over the land, and a
    dry season during the winter months, when dry winds blow from the Asian land
    mass back to the ocean
Terrain:
    surface in the northern Pacific dominated by a clockwise, warm-water gyre
    (broad, circular system of currents) and in the southern Pacific by a
    counterclockwise, cool-water gyre; sea ice occurs in the Bering Sea and Sea
    of Okhotsk during winter and reaches maximum northern extent from Antarctica
    in October; the ocean floor in the eastern Pacific is dominated by the East
    Pacific Rise, while the western Pacific is dissected by deep trenches; the
    world's greatest depth is 10,924 meters in the Marianas Trench
Natural resources:
    oil and gas fields, polymetallic nodules, sand and gravel aggregates, placer
    deposits, fish
Environment:
    endangered marine species include the dugong, sea lion, sea otter, seals,
    turtles, and whales; oil pollution in Philippine Sea and South China Sea;
    dotted with low coral islands and rugged volcanic islands in the
    southwestern Pacific Ocean; subject to tropical cyclones (typhoons) in
    southeast and east Asia from May to December (most frequent from July to
    October); tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico and strike
    Central America and Mexico from June to October (most common in August and
    September); southern shipping lanes subject to icebergs from Antarctica;
    occasional El Nino phenomenon occurs off the coast of Peru when the trade
    winds slacken and the warm Equatorial Countercurrent moves south, killing
    the plankton that is the primary food source for anchovies; consequently,
    the anchovies move to better feeding grounds, causing resident marine birds
    to starve by the thousands because of their lost food source
Note:
    the major choke points are the Bering Strait, Panama Canal, Luzon Strait,
    and the Singapore Strait; the Equator divides the Pacific Ocean into the
    North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean; ships subject to
    superstructure icing in extreme north from October to May and in extreme
    south from May to October; persistent fog in the northern Pacific from June
    to December is a hazard to shipping; surrounded by a zone of violent
    volcanic and earthquake activity sometimes referred to as the Pacific Ring
    of Fire

:Pacific Ocean Economy

Overview:
    The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world economy and
    particularly to those nations its waters directly touch. It provides cheap
    sea transportation between East and West, extensive fishing grounds,
    offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and sand and gravel for the
    construction industry. In 1985 over half (54%) of the world's total fish
    catch came from the Pacific Ocean, which is the only ocean where the fish
    catch has increased every year since 1978. Exploitation of offshore oil and
    gas reserves is playing an ever-increasing role in the energy supplies of
    Australia, New Zealand, China, US, and Peru. The high cost of recovering
    offshore oil and gas, combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil
    since 1985, has slowed but not stopped new drillings.
Industries:
    fishing, oil and gas production

:Pakistan Economy

Overview:
    Pakistan is a poor Third World country faced with the usual problems of
    rapidly increasing population, sizable government deficits, and heavy
    dependence on foreign aid. In addition, the economy must support a large
    military establishment and provide for the needs of 4 million Afghan
    refugees. A real economic growth rate averaging 5-6% in recent years has
    enabled the country to cope with these problems. Almost all agriculture and
    small-scale industry is in private hands. In 1990, Pakistan embarked on a
    sweeping economic liberalization program to boost foreign and domestic
    private investment and lower foreign aid dependence. The SHARIF government
    has denationalized several state-owned firms and has attracted some foreign
    investment. Pakistan likely will have difficulty raising living standards
    because of its rapidly expanding population. At the current rate of growth,
    population would double in 25 years.

:Panama Economy

Overview:
    GDP expanded by roughly 9.3% in 1991, following growth of 4.6% in 1990 and a
    0.4% contraction in 1989. Delay in coming to terms with the international
    financial institutions on policies to implement structural reform in Panama
    generated uncertainty in the private sector and tempered the pace of
    business expansion in 1991. Public investment was limited as the
    administration kept the fiscal deficit below 3% of GDP. Unemployment and
    economic reform are the two major issues the government must face in
    1992-93.

:Papua New Guinea Economy

Overview:
    Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural resources, but exploitation
    has been hampered by the rugged terrain and the high cost of developing an
    infrastructure. Agriculture provides a subsistence livelihood for 85% of the
    population. Mining of numerous deposits, including copper and gold, accounts
    for about 60% of export earnings. Budgetary support from Australia and
    development aid under World Bank auspices have helped sustain the economy.
    Robust growth in 1991 was led by the mining sector; the opening of a large
    new gold mine featured in the advance.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $3.1 billion, per capita $800; real growth rate

:Paraguay Economy

Overview:
    Agriculture, including forestry, accounts for about 25% of GDP, employs
    about 45% of the labor force, and provides the bulk of exports. Paraguay has
    no known significant mineral or petroleum resources but does have a large
    hydropower potential. Since 1981 economic performance has declined compared
    with the boom period of 1976-81, when real GDP grew at an average annual
    rate of nearly 11%. During the period 1982-86 real GDP fell in three of five
    years, inflation jumped to an annual rate of 32%, and foreign debt rose.
    Factors responsible for the erratic behavior of the economy were the
    completion of the Itaipu hydroelectric dam, bad weather for crops, and weak
    international commodity prices for agricultural exports. In 1987 the economy
    experienced a minor recovery because of improved weather conditions and
    stronger international prices for key agricultural exports. The recovery
    continued through 1990, on the strength of bumper crops in 1988-89. In a
    major step to increase its economic activity in the region, Paraguay in
    March 1991 joined the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), which includes
    Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. During 1991 the government began to more
    seriously address its arrearages with international creditors and its
    domestic fiscal problems. Inflation was cut in third, but the foreign trade
    deficit widened to more than $1 billion. For the long run, the government
    must press forward with general market-oriented economic reforms.

:Peru Government

Long-form name:
    Republic of Peru
Type:
    in transition, President FUJIMORI on 5 April 1992 suspended the constitution
    and dissolved the legislative and judicial branches
Capital:
    Lima

    24 departments (departamentos, singular - departamento) and 1 constitutional
    province* (provincia constitucional); Amazonas, Ancash, Apurimac, Arequipa,

    Libertad, Lambayeque, Lima, Loreto, Madre de Dios, Moquegua, Pasco, Piura,
    Puno, San Martin, Tacna, Tumbes, Ucayali; note - the 1979 Constitution and
    legislation enacted from 1987 to 1990 mandate the creation of regions
    (regiones, singular - region) intended to function eventually as autonomous
    economic and administrative entities; so far, 12 regions have been
    constituted from 23 existing departments - Amazonas (from Loreto), Andres
    Avelino Caceres (from Huanuco, Pasco, Junin), Arequipa (from Arequipa),

    (from San Martin), Ucayali (from Ucayali); formation of another region has
    been delayed by the reluctance of the constitutional province of Callao to

:Peru Economy

Overview:
    The Peruvian economy is becoming increasingly market oriented, with a large
    dose of government ownership remaining in mining, energy, and banking. In
    the 1980s the economy suffered from hyperinflation, declining per capita
    output, and mounting external debt. Peru was shut off from IMF and World
    Bank support in the mid-1980s because of its huge debt arrears. An austerity
    program implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI government took office in
    July 1990 contributed to a third consecutive yearly contraction of economic
    activity, but the slide halted late in the year, and output rose 2.4% in
    1991. After a burst of inflation as the austerity program eliminated
    government price subsidies, monthly price increases eased to the
    single-digit level and by December 1991 dropped to the lowest increase since
    mid-1987. Lima obtained a financial rescue package from multilateral lenders
    in September 1991, and, although it faces $14 billion in arrears on its
    external debt, is working to pay some $1.8 billion of these to the IMF and
    World Bank by 1993.

:Poland Economy

Overview:
    Poland is undergoing a difficult transition from a Soviet-style economy -
    with state ownership and control of productive assets - to a market economy.
    On January 1, 1990, the new Solidarity-led government implemented shock
    therapy by slashing subsidies, decontrolling prices, tightening the money
    supply, stabilizing the foreign exchange rate, lowering import barriers, and
    restraining state sector wages. As a result, consumer goods shortages and
    lines disappeared, and inflation fell from 640% in 1989 to 60% in 1991.
    Western governments, which hold two-thirds of Poland's $48 billion external
    debt, pledged in 1991 to forgive half of Poland's official debt by 1994, and
    the private sector grew, accounting for 22% of industrial production and 40%
    of nonagricultural output by 1991. Production fell in state enterprises,
    however, and the unemployment rate climbed steadily from virtually nothing
    in 1989 to 11.4% in December 1991. Poland fell out of compliance with its
    IMF program by mid-1991, and talks with commercial creditors stalled. The
    increase in unemployment and the decline in living standards led to popular
    discontent and a change in government in January 1991 and again in December.
    The new government has promised selective industrial intervention, some
    relaxation in monetary policy, and an improved social safety net, but will
    be constrained by the decline in output and the growing budget deficit.

:Portugal Economy

Overview:
    Although Portugal has experienced strong growth since joining the EC in 1986
    - at least 4% each year through 1990 - it remains one of the poorest
    members. To prepare for the European single market, the government is
    restructuring and modernizing the economy and in 1989 embarked on a major
    privatization program. The global slowdown and tight monetary policies to
    counter inflation caused growth to slow in 1991, but it is likely to recover
    in 1992.

:Puerto Rico Economy

Overview:
    Puerto Rico has one of the most dynamic economies in the Caribbean region.
    Industry has surpassed agriculture as the primary sector of economic
    activity and income. Encouraged by duty free access to the US and by tax
    incentives, US firms have invested heavily in Puerto Rico since the 1950s.
    Important new industries include pharmaceuticals, electronics, textiles,
    petrochemicals, and processed foods. Sugar production has lost out to dairy
    production and other livestock products as the main source of income in the
    agricultural sector. Tourism has traditionally been an important source of
    income for the island. The economy has largely recovered from the
    disruptions caused by Hurricane Hugo in September 1989. The tourism
    infrastructure has been especially hard hit.
